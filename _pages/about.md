I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu/), advised by Prof. [Furong Huang](https://furong-huang.com/).

My research interests lie in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), specifically focusing on synthetic data, reasoning, and agents. My previous research has primarily focused on enhancing the diverse capabilities of LLMs (especially reasoning) and on synthetic data. I am currently working on improving the agent capabilities of LLMs.
