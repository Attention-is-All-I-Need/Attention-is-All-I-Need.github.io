I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu/), advised by Prof. [Furong Huang](https://furong-huang.com/).

My research interests lie in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with a particular focus on synthetic data, reasoning, and agentic capabilities. Earlier projects centered on improving the reasoning depth and breadth of LLMs through principled data generation and distillation. I am currently exploring how to endow LLMs with stronger agent behaviors.
